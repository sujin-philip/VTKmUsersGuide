\chapter{Basic Provisions}
\label{chap:BasicProvisions}

This section describes the core facilities provided by VTK-m. These include
macros, types, and classes that define the environment in which code is
run, the core types of data stored, and template introspection. We also
start with a description of package structure used by VTK-m.

\section{Package Structure}
\label{sec:PackageStructure}

\index{packages|seealso{namespace}}
\index{packages|(}

VTK-m is organized in a hierarchy of nested packages. VTK-m places
definitions in \keyterm{namespaces} \index{namespace} that correspond to
the package (with the exception that one package may specialize a template
defined in a different namespace).

The base package is named \vtkm{}. All classes within VTK-m are placed
either directly in the \vtkm{} package or in a package beneath it. This
helps prevent name collisions between VTK-m and any other library.

As described in Section~\ref{sec:StructureOfVTKmFramework}, the VTK-m API
is divided into two distinct environments: \index{environments} the control
environment \index{control~environment} and the execution
environment. \index{execution~environment} The API for these two
environments are located in the \vtkmcont{} and \vtkmexec{} packages,
respectively. Items located in the base \vtkm{} namespace are available in
both environments.

Although it is conventional to spell out names in identifiers (see the
coding conventions in Chapter~\ref{chap:CodingConventions}), there is an
exception to abbreviate control and execution to \textnamespace{cont}
and \textnamespace{exec}, respectively. This is because it is also part of
the coding convention to declare the entire namespace when using an
identifier that is part of the corresponding package. The shorter names
make the identifiers easier to read, faster to type, and more feasible to
pack lines in 80 column displays. These abbreviations are also used instead
of more common abbreviations (e.g. ctrl for control) because, as part of
actual English words, they are easier to type.

\fix{Probably put a paragraph on filters here and move this paragraph
  lower.}

Worklets provided by VTK-m, described in
Chapter~\ref{chap:ProvidedWorklets}, are contained in the \vtkmworklet{}
package. Although the operation of a worklet happens exclusively in the
execution environment, worklets are typically initialized in the control
environment. Thus, the \vtkmworklet{} package is not encapsulated in either
\vtkmcont{} or \vtkmexec{}.

VTK-m provides a base set of library functions that are ported to
the various systems and compilers on which it is used. These functions are
located in the \vtkmmath{} package. The features in \vtkmmath{} are available
in both the control and execution environments, but they are typically used
in the execution environment.

VTK-m contains code that uses specialized compiler features, such as those
with CUDA and OpenMP, or libraries, such as Intel Threading Building
Blocks, that will not be available on all machines. Code for these features
are encapsulated in their own packages: \vtkmcuda{}, \vtkmopenmp{}, and
\vtkmtbb{}. Within each one of these packages, there will
be \textnamespace{cont} and \textnamespace{exec} namespaces as necessary to
denote features that are accessible in only one environment or the
other. \fix{I'm thinking of reversing this to put the device-specific
  namespaces under \vtkmcont{}. We have yet to need a device-specific thing
  in \vtkmexec{}.}

VTK-m contains OpenGL interoperability \index{OpenGL}
\index{interoperability} that allows data generated with VTK-m to be
efficiently transferred to OpenGL objects. This feature is encapsulated in
the \vtkmopengl{} package.

Figure~\ref{fig:Packages} provides a diagram of the VTK-m package hierarchy.

By convention all classes will be defined in a file with the same name as
the class name (with a \textfilename{.h} extension) located in a directory
corresponding to the package name. For example, the \vtkmcont{ArrayHandle}
class is found in the \vtkmheader{vtkm/cont}{ArrayHandle.h} header. There
are, however, exceptions to this rule. Some smaller classes and types are
grouped together for convenience. These exceptions will be noted as
necessary.

Within each namespace there may also
be \textnamespace{internal}\indexnamespaceone{internal}
and \textnamespace{detail}\indexnamespaceone{detail}
sub-namespaces. The \textnamespace{internal} namespaces contain features
that are used internally and may change without
notice. The \textnamespace{detail} namespaces contain features that are
used by a particular class but must be declared outside of that
class. Users should generally ignore classes in these namespaces.

\section{Function and Method Exports}
\label{sec:FunctionAndMethodExports}

Any function or method defined by VTK-m must come with an export modifier
that determines in which environments the function may be run. These export
modifiers are C macros that VTK-m uses to instruct the compiler for which
architectures to compile each method. Most user code outside of VTK-m need
not use these macros with the important exception of any classes passed to
VTK-m. This occurs when defining new worklets, array containers, and device
adapters.

VTK-m provides three export macros, \vtkmcontexport, \vtkmexecexport, and
\vtkmexeccontexport, which are used to declare functions and methods that
can run in the control environment, export environment, and both
environments, respectively. These macros get defined by including just
about any VTK-m header file, but including \vtkmheader{vtkm}{Types.h} will
ensure they are defined. 

The export macro is place after the template declaration, if there is one,
and before the return type for the function. Here is a simple example of a
function that will square a value. Since most types you would use this
function on have operators in both the control and execution environments,
the function is exported to both places.

\vtkmlisting{Usage of export macro.}{ExportMacro.cxx}

The primary function of the export macros is to interject compiler-specific
keywords that specify what architecture to compile code for. For example,
when compiling with CUDA\index{CUDA}, the control exports have
\textcode{\_\_host\_\_} in them and execution exports have
\textcode{\_\_device\_\_} in them.

There is one additional export macro that is not used for functions but
rather used when declaring a constant data object that is used in the
execution environment. This macro is named
\vtkmmacro{VTKM\_EXEC\_CONSTANT\_EXPORT}\index{export!constant}\index{constant~export}
and is used to declare a constant lookup table used when executing a
worklet. Its primary reason for existing is to add a
\textcode{\_\_constant\_\_} keyword when compiling with CUDA. This export
currently has no effect on any other compiler.
